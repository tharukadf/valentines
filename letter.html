They say without music, life would be a mistake. I spent my life never really thinking of what it could mean. I spent my whole life listening to music. Probably hearing every possible combination of notes that could  ever exist. It didn't mean all that much to me. Nor did I really care about it.  That is, until you came to my life. Suddenly every note, every lyric, every beat started making so much sense. And I started looking for you in between the lines of every song I hear. And then every song I hear was about you. You are the music to my life Mariyam. So my life would be a mistake if I don't have you.

<br><br> Today is our first Valentine's together. Thank you for always being my person, my best friend, my joy and my everything. Thank you for teaching me the true meaning of love I've been searching for my whole life. You mean the world to me Mariyam. No matter how far away you are from me, my love for you only grows day by day, even bigger than the distance between us. I wanted to build this little space just for you— a small pixelated corner on the internet that belongs only to us. This is not how I planned our day to go. I'm sorry about that. I swear I'll make it up to you once we see each other again. Until then, keep being the music to my life. Meow :3
<!-- <center>"You are my way of life<br>

<br><br>Will forever love you the mostest!!!<br><br>
